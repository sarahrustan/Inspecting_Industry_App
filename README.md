# Inspecting_Industry_App

Inspecting Industry was developed in four weeks as part of the Insight Data Science Boston program. The goal of the project was to help the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) reduce severe workplace injury by predicting the risk of injury in order to optimize personnel allocation and target inspections more efficiently. 

The project combined data on severe workplace injuries from OSHA with data on the geographic distribution of the workforce by industry from County Business Patterns (US Census Bureau). Risk levels were predicted for 3,142 counties and 48 states using a Bayesian model, and these risk levels were used to optimize the allocation of OSHA's 2,100 employees.

The Inspecting Industry App visualizes the geographic risk of severe workplace injury using R/Shiny.
